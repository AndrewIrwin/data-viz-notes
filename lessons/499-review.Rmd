# R Review {.unnumbered}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(DT)
library(readxl)
funs <- read_excel(here("lessons/static", "functions.xlsx"), sheet = 1)
```

This page summarizes all the R functions and packages described in the course.
You can sort the following table by function, package, or lesson. You can also search the table for the function or the description.

This table will be updated and expanded throughout the term.

I strongly encourage you to make your own notes about functions you learn to use. 

:::{.column-page}
```{r echo=FALSE}
funs |> select(-Type) |>
  select(Object, Description, Example, Lesson, Package, everything()) |>
  datatable(rownames = FALSE)
```
:::

Note that the `tidyverse` package includes the following packages: `r cat(paste(tidyverse_packages(), collapse=", "))`
