# Reconstructing a visualization

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Goal

In this lesson we will find a visualization and try to reconstruct it using R.

A reasonable challenge is to redraw a version of the [textbook](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Stats/muxnswEACAAJ) cover for STAT 1060 [@DeVeaux] using the `gapminder` data.
